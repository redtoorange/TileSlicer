## SpritePuncher

A simple tool to automate boring spritesheet tasks.  

#### Tile Puncher Mode

Have a spritesheet that needs to be punched into individual sprites?  No problem.  In tile puncher mode you 
can easily karate chop a spritesheet into pieces.  Borders and padding are supported and will provide little defense to 
those annoying sprites.

#### Tile Padder Mode

Have a sprite sheet that is packed too tightly?  Have ugly black lines when you use a tiled map?  We got you.  A 
simple solution to the power of two rounding most 2D engines suffer from is to simply add a pixel of padding around all 
your sprites.  Let SpritePuncher give those sprites a talking to, they will happily expand their outer pixels to create 
a nice clean padding.

#### Usage

1. Select the tab you'd like
2. Select the right file
3. Tweak the parameters
4. Punch those sprites into submission.
